This is a fork of https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6
that creates an 'apt' repository for both Sun Java 6 and Oracle Java 7.

By running this script to download Java you acknowledge that you have
read and accepted the terms of the Oracle end user license agreement.

If you want to see what this is script is doing while it is running then execute
the following from another shell:

  tail -f ./build.log

Usage

  sudo ./oab-java.sh

Optional parameters
  -c | --clean : Remove pre-existing packages from '/var/local/oab/deb'
  -h | --help : This help message

How do I download and run this thing?
=====================================
Like this.

  cd ~/
  git clone https://github.com/tamersaadeh/oab-java.git
  cd oab-java/
  sudo ./oab-java.sh

How it works
============
This script is merely a wrapper for the most excllent Debian packaging
scripts prepared by Janusz Dziemidowicz.

  - https://github.com/rraptorr/sun-java6
  - https://github.com/rraptorr/oracle-java7

This script is Based on the scirpt prepared by Martin Wimpress.

  - https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6

The basic execution steps are:

  - Remove, my now disabled, Java PPA 'ppa:flexiondotorg/java'.
  - Install the tools required to build the Java packages.
  - Create download cache in '/var/local/oab/pkg'.
  - Download the i586 and x64 Java install binaries from Oracle. Yes, both are required.
  - Clone the build scripts from https://github.com/rraptorr/sun-java6 and https://github.com/rraptorr/oracle-java7
  - Build the Java packages applicable to your system.
  - Create local 'apt' repository in '/var/local/oab/deb' for the newly built Java Packages.
  - Create a GnuPG signing key in '/var/local/oab/gpg' if none exists.
  - Sign the local 'apt' repository using the local GnuPG signing key.

What gets installed?
====================
Nothing!

This script will no longer try and directly install or upgrade any Java
packages, instead a local 'apt' repository is created that hosts locally
built Java packages applicable to your system. It is up to you to install
or upgrade the Java packages you require using 'apt-get', 'aptitude' or
'synaptic', etc. For example, once this script has been run you can simply
install the JRE by executing the following from a shell.

  sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre
  or:
  sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-jre

Or if you already have the "official" Ubuntu packages installed then you
can upgrade by executing the folowing from a shell.

  sudo apt-get upgrade

The local 'apt' repository is just that, **local**. It is not accessible
remotely and oab-java.sh will never enable that capability to ensure
compliance with Oracle's asinine license requirements.

Known Issues
============

  - The Oracle download servers can be horribly slow. My script caches the
    downloads so you only need download each file once.

What is 'oab'?
==============
Because, O.A.B! ;-)

     - Closes : https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6/issues/10

0.1.7
-----

  * Fixed GPG key creation on VMware ESX Server
     - Closes : https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6/issues/11
  * Fixed clone of the 'sun-java6' repository for users behind restrictive 
    firewalls, thanks to Thorsten MÃ¶llers

0.1.6
-----
 
  * Fixed downloading of common.sh when ca-certificates is not installed
     - Closes : https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6/issues/3
  * Updated to support Java6u31
     - Closes : https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6/issues/7
     - Closes : https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6/issues/8
     - NOTE! Requires that the upstream script tags Java6u31 as stable, see the 
       following ticket https://github.com/rraptorr/sun-java6/issues/3     
  * Prevent script from running under Ubuntu Precise as it is currently 
    known to be unsupported.
     - Closes : https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6/issues/4
  * Prevent automated key generation when running in an OpenVZ 
    container because I'm too stupid to work out a proper solution

0.1.5
-----

  * Fixed missing code that actually does the build

0.1.4
-----

  * Added GnuPG signing of the local 'apt' repository
  * Updated package building to preserve the upstream package urgency
  * Refactored to remove hard coded versions, now uses 'debian/changelog'
  * Fixed the 'override' file generation to ensure it doesn't contain duplicates
  * Updated documentation

0.1.3
-----

  * Added checking out of tagged releases of the upstream scripts
     - Closes : https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6/issues/1
  * Added loose distribution checking so it should now work with Linux Mint and
    other Ubuntu derivatives
     - Closes : https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6/issues/2
  * Added the creation of a local 'apt' repository
  * Removed installation of Java packages, you can now use 'apt-get' yourself
  * Updated documentation

0.1.2
-----

  * Fixed build requirements
  * Fixed install of 'ia32-sun-java6-bin' on 64-bit systems
  * Fixed install of Java browser plugin on systems without a supported browser
  * Added runtime requirements
  * Added TODO
  * Updated documentation

0.1.1
-----

  * Updated to use dynamic version detection throughout
  * Fixed package installation when upgrading
  * Minor documentation updates

0.1.0
-----

  * Initial release

Todo
====

* Remove automatic signing key generation and add support for selecting a
  pre-existing signing key.
* Add support to build for a given Ubuntu distribution.
* Add support to optionally build using 'pbuilder'.
* New Issue: Does not exit after an error occurs.
