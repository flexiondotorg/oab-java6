OAB-Java6
=========
oab-java6.sh v0.2.1 - Create a local 'apt' repository for Ubuntu Java packages.

By running this script to download Java you acknowledge that you have
read and accepted the terms of the Oracle end user license agreement.

Usage
-----
::

  sudo ./oab-java6.sh

Optional parameters

* -c : Remove pre-existing packages from /var/local/oab/deb
* -s : Skip building if the packages already exist
* -h : This help

How do I download and run this thing?
-------------------------------------
Like this.
::

  cd ~/
  wget https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6/raw/0.2.1/oab-java6.sh -O oab-java6.sh
  chmod +x oab-java6.sh
  sudo ./oab-java6.sh

If you are behind a proxy you may need to run using:
::

  sudo -i ./oab-java6.sh

If you want to see what this script is doing while it is running then execute
the following from another shell:
::

  tail -f ./oab-java6.sh.log

How it works
------------
This script is merely a wrapper for the most excellent Debian packaging
scripts prepared by Janusz Dziemidowicz.

* https://github.com/rraptorr/sun-java6

The basic execution steps are:

* Remove, my now disabled, Java PPA 'ppa:flexiondotorg/java'.
* Install the tools required to build the Java packages.
* Create download cache in /var/local/oab/pkg.
* Download the i586 and x64 Java install binaries from Oracle. Yes, both are required.
* Clone the build scripts from https://github.com/rraptorr/sun-java6
* Build the Java packages applicable to your system.
* Create local apt repository in /var/local/oab/deb for the newly built Java Packages.
* Create a GnuPG signing key in /var/local/oab/gpg if none exists.
* Sign the local apt repository using the local GnuPG signing key.

What gets installed?
--------------------
Nothing!

This script will no longer try and directly install or upgrade any Java
packages, instead a local apt repository is created that hosts locally
built Java packages applicable to your system. It is up to you to install
or upgrade the Java packages you require using apt-get, aptitude or
synaptic, etc. For example, once this script has been run you can simply
install the JRE by executing the following from a shell.
::

  sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre

Or if you already have the *"official"* Ubuntu packages installed then you
can upgrade by executing the following from a shell.
::

  sudo apt-get upgrade

The local apt repository is just that, **local**. It is not accessible
remotely and oab-java6.sh will never enable that capability to ensure
compliance with Oracle's asinine license requirements.

Known Issues
------------

* The Oracle download servers can be horribly slow. My script caches the downloads so you only need download each file once.

What is 'oab'?
--------------
Because, O.A.B! ;-)
